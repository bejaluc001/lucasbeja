 Hey, I am Lucas! I am currently a freshman double majoring in Business and Sustainability Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born in Mexico city but Iâ€™ve been living in Houston, TX since I was 10 years old. I have 2 sisters (Cecil and Ameli) and 2 dogs (Maxi and Puma), one of them is a schnoodle and the other is a boxer. </p>
