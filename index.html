<p style ="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
 Hey! I am currently a freshman double majoring in Business and Sustainability Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. I was born in Mexico city but I have been living in Houston, TX since I was 10 years old. I have 2 sisters (Cecil and Ameli) and 2 dogs (Maxi and Puma), one of them is a schnoodle and the other is a boxer. In my freetime I love to play basketball, read a book, or work on my MIS homework! </p>
